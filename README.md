# IBM CAPSTONE PROJECT FOR DATA SCIENCE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE - ANALYZING SPACEX LANDINGS TO IMPROVE SUCCESS RATES
# IBM Capstone Project for Data Science Professional Certificate - Analyzing SpaceX Landings to Improve Success Rates
This project is the culminating experience required by the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. I analyze various factors like launch site location, orbit type, payload mass and more using real SpaceX data to determine what goes into making a successful rocket landing. This is done using a comprehensive scope of data analysis techniques, including:
* Web Scraping 
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Feature Engineering
* Predictive Analysis
